# What is this

This was an internship I did, and the main contributions I added can be found within the src/app folder. This repo is solely to display a project I had worked on previously. The motionanalysis page was never implemented into the main project due to lack of time, however I failed to preserve the code. So, while it worked well, it is sadly empty. The main idea of motionanalysis was analyzing pedometer data using the native apps for both IOS and Android to create functions which can determine whether a user is in line, or currently walking.

# Installation

I signed an NDA, so the full project cannot be displayed, but I preserved a private repo of the full project at the end of my internship to maintain to always have a full working version, like I froze the app at that point in time. So if you would like clarification as to how my code fit into the full project, or have other specific questions pertaining to the full app let me know.

If you have any other questions about actually getting the code that I wrote up and running, just to see my code in action, reach out to me. Otherwise, feel free to browse my code.
